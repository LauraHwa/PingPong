PingPong
========

In this project, you are to develop a "ping-pong" client program and a server program. The "ping-pong" client and the server together are used to measure the network's performance in transmitting messages of various sizes. In addition to responding to your "ping-pong" client's messages, your server should have an alternate execution mode in which it acts as a simple web server.
